The peacock is known for its beauty, its glory, its feathers.
Feathers 6 times longer than its body.
Feathers strong enough to protect and keep the bird alive.
Feathers iridescent, breathtaking, and unforgettable.
These feathers are the bird's pride.

But a peacock's beauty does not come easy.
Peacocks are able to eat poisonous plants no other creature can ingest.
Indeed, these plants are the birdâ€™s primary diet.
Poison is the food that gives nutrients to birds to allow those feathers to grow.
That length, that strength, that protection, that beauty.
All from eating poison.

Some in life say, "Struggle is part of the story."
Others say, "Grief is the garden of compassion."
God says, "Suffering is not wasted."

How has the poison that you have been fed, willingly eaten, and had injected made you a better person today?
