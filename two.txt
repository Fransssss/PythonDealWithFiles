But a peacock's beauty does not come easy.
Peacocks are able to eat poisonous plants no other creature can ingest.
Indeed, these plants are the birdâ€™s primary diet.
Poison is the food that gives nutrients to birds to allow those feathers to grow.
That length, that strength, that protection, that beauty.
All from eating poison.
